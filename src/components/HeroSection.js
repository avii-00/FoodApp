          The FoodLovers started in 2021 with the intention of creating an
          online magazine featuring the webâ€™s most innovative food bloggers,
          their recipes, and their photography. The recipes are fresh, seasonal,
          mostly simple, often healthy, and sometimes peppered with a little
          cheese and butter mixed in.
